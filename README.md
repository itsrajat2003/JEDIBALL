JEDIBALL is an exciting, fast-paced Pygame arcade game where you control a powerful, sacred ball destined for the Jedi Temple. Your mission? Dodge monstrous enemies and survive long enough to reach a score of 600 to deliver the ball safely.

You switch the ball’s path between the ceiling and the ground by clicking or pressing any key. But beware — a cunning monster appears on either path at random, trying to stop your journey. With each passing second, the game gets faster and more intense, pushing your reflexes to the limit.

The game opens with a cinematic Star Wars-style intro and atmospheric background music, setting the stage for your mission. Funny monster taunts appear if you get caught, and you’ll need to click to try again. A celebratory temple scene is shown when you reach your goal.
